# Warehouse application

A simple .Net Core backend application for warehouse. 

## Start application

- install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/);
- run `docker-compose up -id` in the root of the application folder, where `docker-compose.yml` is located;
- endpoint **documentation**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
- backend api basic **healthcheck** endpoint: [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health)

## Database design

## File upload specification
- you can upload a json file containing the articles via [http://localhost:8080/api/Inventory/upload](http://localhost:8080/api/Inventory/upload). The json file is expected to have the following structure: 


```json
{
  "inventory": [
    {
      "art_id": "1",
      "name": "leg",
      "stock": "12"
    },
    {
      "art_id": "2",
      "name": "screw",
      "stock": "17"
    },
    {
      "art_id": "3",
      "name": "seat",
      "stock": "2"
    },
    {
      "art_id": "4",
      "name": "table top",
      "stock": "1"
    }
  ]
}
````

- you can upload a json file containing the products via [http://localhost:8080/api/Products/upload](http://localhost:8080/api/Products/upload). The json file is expected to have the following structure (all the articles in the product must be predefind in warehouse): 

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Dining Chair",
      "contain_articles": [
        {
          "art_id": "1",
          "amount_of": "4"
        },
        {
          "art_id": "2",
          "amount_of": "8"
        },
        {
          "art_id": "3",
          "amount_of": "1"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Dinning Table",
      "contain_articles": [
        {
          "art_id": "1",
          "amount_of": "4"
        },
        {
          "art_id": "2",
          "amount_of": "8"
        },
        {
          "art_id": "4",
          "amount_of": "1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Branches
- `main`: contains everything
- `develop`: the develop branch; all the feature branches will be merged to the develop branch;
- `test`, `acc` and `prod`: follows the order `test` => `acc` => `prod`;

## Bersions:
the `prod` branch has the version tag


## Discission points

####    serverless or monolithic
- why not choose `serverless`? it is possible that the application can be written using aws lambdas or azure functions. The major reasons not choose the serverless design are: 1) warehouse is at this moment relatively simple, chosing serverless is bit overkill; 2) simplicity for ops and code base;
-  why not choose `monolithic`? while warehouse is relatively simple at this moment.The functionalities can grow very fast and the user base can also very large. It is also possible that we could have mutiple client applications (web front end, mobile apps etc);

#### application design
- this application focuses on the backend API (RESTful api);
- if time allows, build a frontend web application using (Angular, REACT or vue) will be ideal;

#### SQL vs NON-SQL
SQL database is chosen over non-sql with the assumption that the application is written heavy.

#### deployment && scalability
the application is dockerized and can be deployed as containers using popular cloud providers or kubernetes clusters;
